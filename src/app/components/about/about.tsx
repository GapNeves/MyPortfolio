          I am a graduate in Internet Computing Technology from Faculdade Tecnol√≥gica SENAI-MG and
          currently, I am dedicated to studying Web Development to improve my knowledge. My skills
          encompass strong knowledge of JavaScript, React, Node.JS, and other languages and
          frameworks relevant to web development. I hold a keen interest in agile methodologies such
          as Scrum and Kanban, which I find crucial for effective software project management. I
          seek environments that offer flexibility and personal development opportunities, with the
          ultimate goal of expanding my web development skills to make a positive impact on a global
          scale.

          <p>
            I am a graduate in Internet Computing Technology from Faculdade Tecnol√≥gica SENAI-MG and currently, I am dedicated to studying Web Development  to improve my knowledge. My skills encompass strong knowledge of JavaScript, React, Node.JS, and other languages and frameworks relevant to web development. I hold a keen interest in agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban, which I find crucial for effective software project management. I seek environments that offer flexibility and personal development opportunities, with the ultimate goal of expanding my web development skills to make a positive impact on a global scale.
